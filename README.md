smartclicker
============

SmartClicker is a Lock-screen and widget addition to the Open Data Kit android app. It goal of the extension is to allow the user to quickly complete a form without logging into the application.

The application was created as part of a Hacking autism project to support special education classrooms where teachers are too busy with other tasks to take time to fill out a form on ODK-Collect. The lock screen or dashboard widget would allow the teacher to quickly complete a form on their phone.

The original problem started at the Sanitation Hackathon and can be see here: http://www.sanitationhackathon.org/open-data-kit-smart-clicker
